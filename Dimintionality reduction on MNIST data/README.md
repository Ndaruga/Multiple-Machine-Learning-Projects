# Dimentionality Reduction

Dimensionality reduction, or dimension reduction, is the transformation of data from a high-dimensional space into a low-dimensional space so that the low-dimensional representation retains some meaningful properties of the original data, ideally close to its intrinsic dimension.

in this project we will be using 
<li>T-stochastic Neighbour Embedding</li>
<li>SDD</li>
