# The Titanic Project

On April 15, 1912, the widely considered "The Unsinkerable" RMS Titanic sank after it hit an iceberg. The unfortunate incident claimed the lives of 1502 out of 2224 passangers and crew members on board.

It is also an unfortunate coincidence that, at the time of the horrific accident, the RMS Titanic ship did not have enough lifeboats to accomodate everyone on board.

while some people 'miraclously' survived, there seeems to be some pattern of people who survived.

### The Objective
We want to find out what characters of people were likely to survive the incident


## Primary Data analysis
The Titanic data folder contains 3 files
<ul>
<li>Training set</li>
<li>Test set</li>
<li>Gender submission</li>
</ul>

### Train set
It contains 891 rows and 12 columns
